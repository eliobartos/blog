  Hi! My name is Elio. I am a mathematician interested in statistics, data science and gaming. Welcome to my blog!
</p>

### Professional Interests

* **statistics** - especially Bayesian statistics which I find more intuitive and more appropriate than frequentistic methods.
* **data analytics** - whether using R, SQL or creting awesome dashboards in Shiny or Tableau, understanding what is going on is like being a detective searching for answers. What has happened and why? 
* **predictive modelling** - many machine learning models come from statistics and have mathematical background. I find them very interesting.
* **presenting results** - this is very important step because if you are unable to pass your results to others, what you did won't make a difference. I often reflect on how I presented results and how to improve it.
* **creating game economy** - creating how things will be generated and calculated in the game is a perfect job for a mathematician. Setting up probabilites and other parameters whether in a video or a board game is a challenging, but very entertaining thing to do. 

### Other Interests
I love playing table tennis, football and beach volleyball. I love singing and playing guitar, especially songs by the three  musketeers of music: Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Tom Waits.

I also love playing and creating board games. Since I was a kid I was always cutting paper, creating cards, taking figures and dices from other games while trying to create my own board game. And when I learned a little bit of programming in QBasic I immediately wanted to make a game. Currently I enjoy playing Hero Realms, Star Wars: X-Wing and King of Tokyo. I highly recommend you to try them!
