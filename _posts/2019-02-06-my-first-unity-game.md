title: My First Unity Game
---

## Intro
One month ago I became very interested in learning how to make a game, how to connect all the code with the objects, backgrounds and menus into something just a little bit playable. I present you: **MyFirstUnityGame**.

Afted that I will share some thoughts on how to start learning something, like game development, to stay motivated until the very end and actually create something. 

## MyFirstUnityGame

Not the most beautiful welcome screen I will admit. But it's mine!

### Download - Windows

You can get some warnings from anti-virus programs because of unknown publisher or they could block running this app, but I assure you that it is safe to install and run this app.

### Download - MAC

You also need to set permissions to open this app. Go to folder where the game is and in terminal run:
`chmod a+x MyFirstUnityGame.app/Contents/MacOS/*`

Here are some screenshots from the game:

## Creation

So I wanted to create some kind of a game. How to start? 

There are bunch of tutorials on the internet. My strategy was to find one that builds the game that I like and that I can work on after the basic tutorial: to add a few features and things that I like to make it mine. I found great tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik" target="_blank">Brackeys</a>. This is a great and short 10 video tutorial, with videos around 5-15 minutes. After watching and following it you have a playable game. 

But then the real fun starts. I wanted finite levels where the goal is to complete the level as soon as possible. So I added speed up and made levels finite. I wanted to get some kind of reward when I complete level quicky. So I added stars. They are used to unlock new levels. I also added sounds, main menu, welcome screen, created 4 levels with different obstacles etc. To add all of these features you just do a lot of googling, watch a few videos and play with Unity. It is easy and you are really motivated because you have playable game. You are not overhelmed because you are adding feature by feature - divide and conquer!

If you want to make a game, I think this is a pretty god way to start. If you have a particular game in mind, it can be really hard to make it if you have zero experience like I had. This process of completing a tutorial to get a basic sense of how to do things and then work on adding feature by feature is really good. And while doing that you have a playable game that you can show to others. It keeps you motivated and you don't have the feeling that this is to hard or overhelming. And then after you make a game or two like this you are in a good position to start working on particular game that you want.

If you just start working on a particular game and then start googling how to do thing number 1, then number 2 etc. at number 10 you will feel exhausted, thinking this is too hard. Start with a simple game, create it an then add feature by feature. Have fun!
